### Custom_GPT2_Text_Generation

Custom GPT-2 Text Generation is a project that fine-tunes the GPT-2 language model on a custom dataset and allows you to generate text based on the fine-tuned model. This README provides an overview of the project, its components, and how to use it effectively.

#### 1-Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/mhadihossaini/Custom_GPT2_Text_Generation

#### 2-Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


#### 3-Fine-Tuning the Model
To fine-tune the GPT-2 model on your custom dataset, follow these steps:

1-Prepare your custom dataset: You can use your own dataset, preprocess it, and create a corpus for fine-tuning.

2-Fine-tune the model: Use the provided scripts to fine-tune the GPT-2 model on your dataset. Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

3-Save the fine-tuned model: Once fine-tuning is complete, save the model for later use.

#### 4-Generating Text
You can generate text using the fine-tuned model by providing a prompt or topic. Follow these steps:

Load the fine-tuned model.

Tokenize the prompt or topic.

Generate text based on the tokenized input.
